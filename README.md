# Garden Simulator

This is a beginner python project from Dataquest. The project can be found [here](https://www.dataquest.io/projects/guided-project-a-garden-simulator-text-based-game/)

## Set Up Plant Class


```python
title = "Garden Simulator"
import random
class Plant:
  def __init__(self, name, harvest_yield):
    self.name = name
    self.harvest_yield = harvest_yield
    self.growth_stages = ['seed', 'sprout', 'plant', 'flower', 'harvest-ready']
    self.current_growth_stage = self.growth_stages[0]
    self.harvestable = False
    
# Step 3
  
  def grow(self): 
    
    def check_harvestable():
      if self.current_growth_stage == self.growth_stages[-1]:
        self.harvestable = True
        print(f"{self.name} is now harvestable.")
      return self.harvestable
    
    if check_harvestable():
      print(f"{self.name} is fully grown.")
    else:
      index = self.growth_stages.index(self.current_growth_stage)
      self.current_growth_stage = self.growth_stages[index + 1]
      check_harvestable()
  
  def harvest(self):
    if self.harvestable:
      self.harvestable = False
      return self.harvest_yield
    else:
      print(f"{self.name} is not harvestable yet.")
      return None
    
```

## Define Plant Types


```python
class Tomato(Plant):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__("Tomato", 5)
    self.growth_stages[3] = 'fruiting'
    
class Lettuce(Plant):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__("Lettuce", 1)

class Carrot(Plant):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__("Carrot", 3)
    self.growth_stages[3] = 'root-developing'

class Strawberry(Plant):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__("Strawberry", 4)
    self.growth_stages[3] = 'berry-developing'

class Potato(Plant):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__("Potato", 6)
    self.growth_stages[3] = 'tuber-developing'
```

## Player Input


```python
def select_item(items) -> Plant | str | None:
  items_list = []
  if type(items) is dict:
    items_list = list(items.keys())
  elif type(items) is list:
    items_list = items
  else:
    print("Invalid input. Please select from the provided options.")
    return None
  
  for i in range(len(items_list)):
        try:
            item_name = items_list[i].name
        except:
            item_name = items_list[i]
        print(f"{i + 1}. {item_name}")
  
  while True:
    try:
      choice = int(input('Enter the number of your choice.'))
      
      if  0 < choice <= len(items_list):
        return items_list[choice - 1]
      else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
    except ValueError:
      print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
      continue

```

## Define Gardener Class


```python
types_of_plants =["tomato", "lettuce", "carrot", "strawberry", "potato"]

class Gardener():
  plant_dict = {
    "tomato": Tomato, 
    "lettuce": Lettuce, 
    "carrot": Carrot, 
    "strawberry": Strawberry, 
    "potato": Potato
}
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self.planted_plants: list[Plant] = []
    self.inventory = {
      "tomato": 1, 
      "lettuce": 5, 
      "carrot": 8, 
      "strawberry": 12, 
      "potato": 6
    }
  
  def plant(self):
    player_input = select_item(self.inventory)
    amt_in_inventory = self.inventory[player_input]
    if amt_in_inventory > 0:
      self.inventory[player_input] -= 1
      new_plant = self.plant_dict[player_input]()
      self.planted_plants.append(new_plant)
      print(f"{self.name} planted a {player_input} plant.")
      
      if self.inventory[player_input] == 0:
        del self.inventory[player_input]
    else:
      print(f"{self.name} has no {player_input} in stock.")
  
  def tend(self):
    for plant in self.planted_plants:
      if plant.harvestable:
        print(f'{plant.name} is ready to harvest!')
      else:
        plant.grow()
      print(f'{plant.name} is at the {plant.current_growth_stage} stage.')
  
  def harvest(self):
    selected_plant = select_item(self.planted_plants)
    
    if selected_plant.harvestable:
      if selected_plant.name in self.inventory:
        self.inventory[selected_plant.name] += selected_plant.harvest()
      else:
        self.inventory[selected_plant.name] = selected_plant.harvest()
      print(f"You harvested a {selected_plant.name}!")
      self.planted_plants.remove(selected_plant)
    else:
      print(f"You can't harvest a {selected_plant.name}!")
        
  def forage_for_seeds(self):
    seed = random.choice(types_of_plants)
    if seed not in self.inventory:
      self.inventory[seed] = 1
    else:
      self.inventory[seed] += 1
    print(f"{self.name} found a {seed} seed!")
```

## Game Loop


```python
# Get the Player's name
player_name = input(f"Welcome to {title}. Please enter your name to begin the game.")

print(f"Welcome {player_name}! Enter 'help' at any time to see a list of commands. Enter 'exit' to exit the game.")

# Create a new Gardener object
gardener = Gardener(player_name)

while True:
  commands = ['forage', 'plant', 'tend', 'harvest', 'quit', 'help']
  print('\nWhat would you like to do?\n')
  for i, command in enumerate(commands, start=1):
    print(command)
  command = input().lower()
  if command not in commands:
    print('Invalid command. Please try again.')
    continue
  match command:
    case 'forage':
      gardener.forage_for_seeds()
    case 'plant':
      gardener.plant()
    case 'tend':
      gardener.tend()
    case 'harvest':
      gardener.harvest()
    case 'quit':
      print(f'Goodbye {gardener.name}! Thanks for playing {title}.')
      break
    case 'help':
      print('\nHere are the available commands:')
      print('forage: Find a seed for a new plant.')
      print('plant: Plant a seed.')
      print('tend: Gently care for your plants.')
      print('harvest: Harvest a ready plant.')
      print('quit: Exit the game.')
